# Annika Tjuka, Linguist 

## About me

I have a Master of Arts degree in Linguistics from the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. In my Master's thesis, I conducted the first systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. 

I am a research associate in the [FAHMRRR](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/fahmrrr/index.html?set_language=en) project, led by Katharina Spalek. We investigate how humans process meaning that goes beyond the individual words in an utterance, concentrating on the processing of focus alternatives. In this project, I am conducting a study which investigates the recall of focus alternatives in Vietnamese.


## Masters Thesis

**Body-part metaphors as a window to cognition: A cross-linguistic study of object and landscape terms**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Elisabeth Verhoeven and Dr. Kilu von Prince

Description: I conducted the first systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. The study consisted of 53 pictures illustrating object and landscape parts which were based on 93 body-part metaphors. The analysis showed that some metaphors are far more consistent across languages than others. For example, 'leg of the chair/table' is present throughout the whole language sample.

## Bachelors Thesis

**Emotionalisation through texts**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Katharina Spalek and Prof. Dr. Manfred Krifka

Description: I collaborated with a software engineer to search my text corpora for emotional words. For this, we created a tool which utilized the Natural Language Processing Kit in Python, so that it could analyze the text corpora and compare them with a list of 3000 words. Afterwards, I analyzed the frequency and psycholinguistic measures of the matching words. The results of my study show that there are more emotional words in donation letters than in stock market letters.
