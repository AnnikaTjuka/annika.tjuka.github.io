# Annika Tjuka, Linguist 

## About me

I am a PhD Student at the International Max Planck Research School for the Science of Human History (IMPRS-SHH). The topic of my research is "Cross-Linguistic Strategies of Denotation: Advancing data and methods in lexical typology". 

I am interested in how different languages classify the objects around them. In my Master's thesis, I conducted the first systematic typological study on body part extensions in object and landscape terms. The cognitive foundation of expressions like 'foot of the mountain' or 'eye of the needle' were also of interest to me. 

My main goal is to accumulate the knowledge of various languages and bring it into the field of psycholinguistics. Thus, in my last project ([FAHMRRR](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/fahmrrr/index.html?set_language=en)), I investigated the recall of focus alternatives in Vietnamese native speakers.


## Masters Thesis

**Body-part metaphors as a window to cognition: A cross-linguistic study of object and landscape terms**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Elisabeth Verhoeven and Dr. Kilu von Prince

Description: I conducted the first systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. The study consisted of 53 pictures illustrating object and landscape parts which were based on 93 body-part metaphors. The analysis showed that some metaphors are far more consistent across languages than others. For example, 'leg of the chair/table' is present throughout the whole language sample.

## Bachelors Thesis

**Emotionalisation through texts**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Katharina Spalek and Prof. Dr. Manfred Krifka

Description: I collaborated with a software engineer to search my text corpora for emotional words. For this, we created a tool which utilized the Natural Language Processing Kit in Python, so that it could analyze the text corpora and compare them with a list of 3000 words. Afterwards, I analyzed the frequency and psycholinguistic measures of the matching words. The results of my study show that there are more emotional words in donation letters than in stock market letters.
