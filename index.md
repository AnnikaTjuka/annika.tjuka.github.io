# Annika Tjuka, Linguist 

## About me

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in German Linguistic and now work on my Masters thesis in Typology combined with Cognitive Linguistics. My thesis looks at body-part metaphors as a window to cognition. I used a targeted elicitation to conduct a cross-linguistic study.

In addition, I am a student research assistant in two different projects. The first is inthe field of experimental pragmatics. In this project we investigate how humans process meaning that goes beyond the individual words in an utterance, concentrating on the processing of focus alternatives. The second one connects typology and semantics. It is concerned with corpus-based research on TAM and polarity expressions in Oceanic languages of Melanesia.

## Curriculum Vitae

### Academic Education

2016 - 2019 **Master of Arts in Linguistics** at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin

2013 - 2016 **Bachelor of Arts in German Linguistics and Scandinavian Studies** at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin


### Masters Thesis

**Body-part metaphors as a window to cognition: A cross-linguistic study of object and landscape terms**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Elisabeth Verhoeven and Dr. Kilu von Prince

Description: I conducted the first systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. The study consisted of 53 pictures illustrating object and landscape parts which were based on 93 body-part metaphors. The analysis showed that some metaphors are far more consistent across languages than others. For example, 'leg of the chair/table' is present throughout the whole language sample.

### Bachelors Thesis

**Emotionalisierung durch Texte**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Katharina Spalek and Prof. Dr. Manfred Krifka

Description: I collaborated with a software engineer to search my text corpora for emotional words. For this, we created a tool which utilized the Natural Language Processing Kit in Python, so that it could analyze the text corpora and compare them with a list of 3000 words. Afterwards, I analyzed the frequency and psycholinguistic measures of the matching words. (Grade: 1.5)


### Work experience (in Academia)

2019 **Reseach Associate** in the [FAHMRRR](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/fahmrrr/index.html?set_language=en) project, funded by the European Research Council (ERC): An investigation of how humans process meaning in utterances, concentrating on focus alternatives.
