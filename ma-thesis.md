**Body-part metaphors as a window to cognition: A cross-linguistic study of object and landscape terms**

Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Elisabeth Verhoeven and Dr. Kilu von Prince

Description: I conducted the first systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. The study consisted of 53 pictures illustrating object and landscape parts which were based on 93 body-part metaphors. The analysis showed that some metaphors are far more consistent across languages than others. For example, 'leg of the chair/table' is present throughout the whole language sample.
